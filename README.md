Set Up
---------------------

* To set up for development, fork this repo and clone locally.
* _Important_: The project uses LESS and compiles to CSS. I made use of a simple less-watch-compiler, which can be found [here](https://github.com/jonycheung/Dead-Simple-LESS-Watch-Compiler). If you have node.js installed on your machine, `cd` into the project directory and run `node less-watch-compiler less css`. This will auto-compile any .less files in the `less` directory into the `css` directory.
